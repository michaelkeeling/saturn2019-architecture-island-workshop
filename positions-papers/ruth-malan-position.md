# Ruth Malan - Architecture Island Position Paper

Charter: What makes software architecture unique, important, and indispensable to
building great software? What is the essence of software architecture? What does
this mean, in terms of core reading for software architects?
 
## The essence of software architecture

I find it useful to start with Grady Booch’s characterization of architecture:

> Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system,
> where significant is measured by cost of change.

It points us to

* Systems
* Design
* Decisions
* Significance
* Cost of change
 
## Core readings for software architects

With this list, we could go right to:

* Systems: Donella Meadows, Thinking in Systems
* Design: Michael Keeling, Design It!
* Decisions: Gary Klein, How People Make Decisions
* Significance: Simon Wardley, Wardley Maps
* Cost of change: Michael Feathers, Working Effectively with Legacy Code

That’s meant to be illustrative, rather than strictly prescriptive.
 
If we had to grab a near to hand, good enough set of books to take on the journey
to a first assignment as a software architect, that would do very nicely. 
 
## Beyond the Core
Just five? That was (too) easy? The reason recommended reading lists for architects
expand pretty fast, is that significance is not just about cost of change (with
implications for modularity, APIs, modeling, views, and more). It’s about strategic
impact and integrity — structural integrity, design integrity including conceptual
integrity, and organizational integrity. And integrity brings with it a slew of
technical considerations, organizational considerations, ethical considerations.
Many papers and books swarm into scope. Perhaps Design Unbound will be the one book
to rule them all – but I’ve only just started reading it.
 
Structural integrity opens up into reliability and resilience, as well as being able
to safely change and adapt the system as more is learned about needs, and the context
shifts. Resilience pulls in works such as Richard Cook’s “How Complex Systems Fail” or
John Gall’s Systemantics, as well as safety topics that don’t stay neatly in the technical
space, because physiological safety impacts the organization’s ability to respond to
failures with honesty and transparency, impacting adaptive capacity. So we get into
Blame-Free Postmortems. 
 
Design decisions mean we need to address making decisions, so understanding context,
surfacing tradeoffs and analyzing them, and exploring alternative approaches and
identifying best fit to desired outcomes, given constraints and tradeoffs. But it also
means we need to consider the organizational ramifications of who makes the decision,
where in the organization and when, and how architecture decisions are shared so they
can be understood and followed. 
 
My intent here is not to be exhaustive, but to illustrate some points in the consideration
space. An architect is in a design leadership role, with responsibilities for socio-technical
systems design. This broadens the demands, and the reading we recommend should reflect that.
