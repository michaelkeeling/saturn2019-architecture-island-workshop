# SATURN 2019 Workshop -- Architecture Island

```
Dear <familiar_name_here>,

Congratulations!  You have been selected to establish a new colony
on Architecture Island!  Your skills in software design have made
you a highly valued member of our crew.  As a software architect,
we imagine you'll want to bring a few books and other resources
with you.  Unfortunately, due to cargo restrictions, it is not
possible for you to bring all the architecture, design, and
programming books from your personal library.  There is only
enough room for the most important information.

Please report to the SATURN docking bay 94 in Pittsburgh, PA on
May 6 to finalize preparations before your journey.  Welcome
to the crew!

Warm regards,

George and Michael
Architecture Island Expedition Leaders

The premise of this workshop is simple.  Our goal is to identify the most
important concepts, ideas, strategies, methods, patterns, and so on, that
all software engineers must know about software architecture.  While the
premise is simple, achieving our goal will be challenging.  During the
[SATURN 2018 workshop on growing great designers](https://github.com/michaelkeeling/saturn2018-growing-great-software-designers-workshop)
we were rather alarmed to see that the list of “required reading for
software architects” easily resulted in a person sized tower of paper.
Indeed, surveys on Twitter and elsewhere have turned up a similarly
long lifetime of reading.  We can do better.  We must do better.

During the workshop we’ll explore what makes software architecture unique,
important, and indispensable to building great software.  By the end of the
workshop we will have distilled the collective wisdom of the group down to
it’s essential core.  Participants will have the opportunity to share their
reflection, takeaways, and lessons as lightning talks throughout the SATURN
conference.

The workshop will take place on Monday, May 6, 2019 in [Pittsburgh, PA during
the SATURN 2019 conference on software architecture](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/news-events/events/saturn/).
Workshop participants are required to be registered for SATURN 2019.
