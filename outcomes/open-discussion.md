# Open Discussion

After lunch, we opened up the forum for general discussion.

* Don't defend architecture, explain why and keep listening
  * Open to the idea that we make mistakes
  * Is it architecture or engineering?
  * Analsis isn't visible
  * Lack of undersatnding -- Zen Garden, a well run 5k, patterns are invisible to others
* Codes (building codes) from failures
  * "Magazine architects"
* Why is title "architect" disfavored
  * Bad stereotypes promoted
  * Flat orgs, agile
  * architecture elevator
* What's the true ROI? Time to Market?
  * See Raymond Slot's thesis
