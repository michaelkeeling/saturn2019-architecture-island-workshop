# Breakout 1: 3 types of systems

Map 10 items of the different categories to the systems, 
prioritize them and mark the most important an MVP absolutely needs.

## System 1: IT System

1. Trade-offs (Most valuable player, MVP)
2. Business understanding
3. Extract stakeholder requirements
4. COTS/Reference architecture (The "draft pick" not found on cards)
5. Competence in technical Environment
6. Architecture Pattern catalog
7. Views
8. Relationship building
9. Architecture Roadmap
10. Manage risks
11. ~~forensics/discovery~~
12. ~~Non-architectural tools~~
* ~~Hoisting~~
* ~~Models~~
* ~~Influence others~~
* ~~Govern architecture~~
* ~~ADLs~~
* ~~Extract stakeholder requirements~~
* ~~Evaluate Quality attributes~~
* ~~Anticipate~~
* ~~System thinking~~
* ~~Wardly maps~~ (considered draft pick)

## System 2: Safety critical

1. System thinking (System failures)
2. Managing risk (Safety risk)
3. Modeling and analysis
4. Attention-directing (Taxanomy, standards)
5. Open, Ethical Culture
6. Understanding context (Requirements, use)
7. Architecture governance (Implementation conformance)
8. Architecture review
9. Technical/Writing/Document Recisions
10. Planning tools (Roadmap)

## System 3: Cloud/SaaS

1. Technical competence
2. System thinking
3. Technical choice (in support of quality attributes)
4. Architecture patterns - MVP
5. Forensic tools
6. Architecture team/guild
7. Trade-offs
8. SRE model
9. Quality attributes: Security, availability, performance, reliability
10. Regulatory compliance

Foundation 1-5 to support quality attributes (9)

other things:
* Decision making at the right time
* Relationship building
