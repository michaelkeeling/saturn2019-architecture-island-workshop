-	Sacrificing one attribute to gain another

## Category: Knoweledge / Expericence 


Use architecture to drive quality attributes
Your architecture choices make it easy or hard to achieve your desired qualities. QA scenarios express what you desire

Technical competence in technical / impl. Environment
Ability + Knowledge necessary to implement the architecture, e.g. Distributes systems, cloud computing

Attention-directing taxonomy 
An organization that helps you design by directing your attention to topics. Example: TOGAF, DOGAF, SWABOK, Design Thinking, Standards, Heuristics 

Architecture Pattern Catalog
A list of names styles, pattern, and tactics that provide quality attributes

## System thinking
Have understanding / experience with complex systems an implications
-	Ho systems fail
-	Resilience
-	Emergence 
-	Interaction with context
## Business understanding 
* Understanding the business direction goal and context
    -	Brands
    -	Domain knowledge 
    -	Business knowledge

* Technical interpreter (18 votes): Explain technology in depth to a developer and at an abstract level to other stakeholders
This enables the architect to communicate ideas and architectural decisions with various levels of the organization “Architect Evaluator” Help other understand the architecture and architecture practice. 

* Influence Other (18 votes): Impact decisions and actions of others to align with the architecture: ensure that a developer works in-line with the architecture, direct business decision to be compatible with technological constraints 

* Relationship building (8 votes): Establish and maintain communication with stakeholders to the architecture. Provides a foundation for collaboration with these people. Gain their trust to enable us to make decisions that impact them. 

* Stakeholder Empathy (11 votes): Understanding somebody else’s motivation, priorities, even emotions to their perspective. Helps us to take a broad view of relevant drivers for the architecture that underpin the architectural decisions

* Technical writing (7 votes)
Concisely communicate technical ideas and decisions to technical and non-technical stakeholders in teat. To keep a record of decisions, ideas, etc. for the future: (documenting the architecture). Conway the architecture.  

* Asking questions (7 votes): Being curious about the other’s positions. Understanding other people’s reasoning. Help others to open up their perspectives. Identify gaps in reasoning.
